<p>SoundCloud webplayer is similar to that of Spotify or Grooveshark</p>
<p>Using the SoundCloud Api, the user is able to search by artist name to search for tracks. Other than Playing and Pausing tracks, the webplayer shows the duration and progress of a song and allows you to change the volume.</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>
<p>Download the entire project folder. 
Download a preprocessor. Prepros is a free preprocessor that I use: <a href="https://prepros.io/">https://prepros.io/</a></p>
<p>After installing Prepros, open it up and click &quot;Add Project&quot; in the bottom left hand corner. Select the &quot;SoundCloud&quot; folder that you&#39;ve downloaded. Navigate to the css folder, and select the &quot;main.sass&quot; folder. In the left hand column click &quot;Process File&quot;. Set the location for the file within the css folder and name the file &quot;main.css&quot;. </p>
<p>With this done, you can now click the &quot;Preview&quot; button at the top of the screen and it will open the project up in a browser. Here you can search for an artist and find tracks. Enjoy!</p>
